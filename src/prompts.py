Prompt definitions for the Litero‑AI Humanizer
=============================================
System‑level prompts used throughout the pipeline.
• **Vanilla models** – document vs paragraph prompts.
• **Fine‑tuned models** – document vs paragraph prompts.
• `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `FINETUNED_SYSTEM_PROMPT` remain as aliases
  for backward compatibility.
• `EVALUATION_PROMPT` is used by the Gemini scorer.

Every prompt stresses **word‑count fidelity**, structure fidelity
(paragraphs, headings, sentences) and forbids the Literka blacklist.

• Keep the original language.
• Do **not** add new facts or drop any information.

Style guidance

(case‑insensitive):
{_BLACKLIST}

Return only the rewritten document – no extra comments.
